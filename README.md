Pole Star Assignment

ReactJS Code Challenge
Utilising the OpenLibrary API, please produce a simple book search engine that 
shows the top 10 book results for a given search term.
• Please create a landing page where you can input the search term i.e. “Lord of the rings”.
• On clicking an OK button, the web app will show the top 10 books (title, cover, author, year etc.) for that 
search.
• We will leave the UI design of the app to the applicant but keep it simple as we do not expect our 
developers to be graphic designers too.
• We expect to see some examples of error handling and input validation.
• We would like the UI to be written with modern ReactJS and CSS
